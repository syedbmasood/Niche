# Investigation Data Quality Issues & Investment Trends in Adult Mental Health Services
The excel spreadsheet "data" contains 3 tabs:
1. Investment: Mental Health Spending by LIT and Service Type
2. Areas: Population figures by LIT and Mapping to SHA and ONS Cluster
3. Service Types: Mapping of Service Types to Service Groups and Age/Cost Groups

The purpose of this analysis was to look at the following:

1. Data quality issues and considerations
2. Compare how levels of investment in Adult Mental Health Services differ between Blackpool and it's statistical neighbours i.e., Plymouth, Sefton, Wirral, North Lincolnshire, Redcar and Cleveland, North Tyneside
3. Hypothesis testing to compare spending on Adult Mental Health Services in London versus the rest of the England via appropriate statistical tests

A jupyter notebook for the same analysis will be uploaded in the near future.
